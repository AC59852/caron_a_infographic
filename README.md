# Simple Squiggles

Hello, and welcome to Simple Squiggles Art Collection. 
<br> 
We have been awarded the honour to display the most influential pieces of art in history, in both miniature and full form.
<br>
Hover over the icons to find the most iconic pieces of said art, if you are good enough, challenge your friends
<br>
and see if they match up to your art expertise! Otherwise, click the see more buttons to view the art in full,
<br>
as well as small snippets of each individual piece.

## Setup

To setup the site, load the database from the **utils** folder locally (this can be done through a SQL terminal, or PHPMyAdmin).
<br>
Open up the project and type **npm install** into the console. This will install all needed packages.
<br>
**Note** Sometimes errors may occur, if so, run **npm install -D nodemon** to resolve said error.
<br>
After the packages are installed, run **npm start** in the console to start the site, then navigate to **localhost:3000** in your browser.
<br>
**Also Note** If you are viewing this on MAC, please go into the config.js and change the port to **8889**, as well as the password to **root**
<br>
After that, the site is good to go!

## Tools Used
**Microsoft Visual Studio Code** - To create the site design, write the code to host a server, and load the page
<br>
**PHPMyAdmin** - To create a SQL table and to host the database
<br>
**Adobe Illustrator** - To create the icons for the iconic art pieces

## Author
**Austin Caron** - Creator of site, generator of assets and dynamic content, and lover of art!

## Future Goals
The plan is to add more paintings and improve the icons functionality, adding more effects to the hover as I learn more
<br>
to improve user interaction and enjoyment.
